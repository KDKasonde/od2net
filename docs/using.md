# Using od2net in your own project

The overall process is:

1.  Create your study area
2.  Prepare origin/destination input
3.  Specify configuration to customize the route cost function, level of traffic stress, uptake model, etc.
4.  Run `odnet` (using Docker or compiling the tool yourself)
5.  Use the web viewer to explore the output, or write your own analysis to use the results

You should do this in your own Github repository, using whatever tools to manage input -- such as Python and R. There are Python examples in this repo.

## Step 1: Creating your study area

## Step 2: Preparing origin/destination input

## Step 3: Customizing

- What kind of question are you trying to answer?
  - Given existing infrastructure, where are gaps in the network to fill?
  - Given existing infrastructure, what quiet routes could use wayfinding?
  - Assuming any current road could radically change, where should infrastructure investments be targeted?

## Step 4: Running od2net

## Step 5: Using the output
